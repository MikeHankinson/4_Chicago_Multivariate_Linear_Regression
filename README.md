# 4_Chicago_Multivariate_Linear_Regression

## Project: Linear Regression (Multivariate)

### Skills and Tools

* Multi-variate linear regression
* Assess multi-collinearity and omitted variable bias
* Evaluate models and selecting predictors
* Perform feature transformations and engineering

### Context
The linear model is a foundational statistical tool that enables performance of supervised modelling (creating a function that maps one or more explanatory variables to a specific target variable). Using the linear model, evaluate the correlation between multiple predictors.  

### Problem Statement
Expand upon the bivariate linear regression model performed previously by including 

### Algorithm Methodology
1. Load data
2. Correlation
3. Build 3 Models with 2 Predictors
4. Compare the slope estimates, standard errors, T-statistics, and P-values
5. Compute and compare confidence intervals for B1 - T-Test
6. Conclusions


### Results
All code to complete this work is found in the attached [notebook](Module6_Homework.R).
