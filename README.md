# 4_Chicago_Multivariate_Linear_Regression

## Project: Linear Regression (Multivariate)

### Skills and Tools

* Multi-variate linear regression
* Assess multi-collinearity and omitted variable bias
* Evaluate models and selecting predictors
* Perform feature transformations and engineering

### Context
The linear model is a foundational statistical tool that enables performance of supervised modelling (creating a function that maps one or more explanatory variables to a specific target variable). Using the linear model, evaluate the correlation between multiple predictors.  

### Problem Statement
Expand upon the [bivariate linear regression model performed previously](https://github.com/MikeHankinson/3_Chicago_Bivariate_Linear_Regression) by including 3 additional independent variables:
1. Real_Estate: Size of primary residence in square feet 
2. Stock: Amount of assets in stock portfolio in thousands of dollars 
3. Previous_Spend: Amount of money spent on jewelry last year 
4. Salary (included in the bivariate linear model in the previous [model](https://github.com/MikeHankinson/3_Chicago_Bivariate_Linear_Regression)). 

### Algorithm Methodology
1. Load data
2. Correlation
3. Build 3 Models with 2 Predictors
4. Compare the slope estimates, standard errors, T-statistics, and P-values
5. Compute and compare confidence intervals for B1 - T-Test
6. Conclusions


### Results
All code to complete this work is found in the attached [notebook](Module6_Homework.R).
